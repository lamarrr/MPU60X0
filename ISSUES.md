If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy:
1. It must be a bug/performance
issue or a feature request or a build issue or a documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead). 
2. Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.
3. The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.
